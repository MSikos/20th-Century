# 20th-Century

Python notebooks with data wrangling, cleaning, and visualizations created for a course on CareerFoundry.

# Objective
For this project, we are imagining that the Institute for Public Policy has employed us to analyze and create visualizations as part of a larger initiative. The institute believes that past events heavily influence the current geopolitical climate.
We are asked to help provide a clearer understanding of the historical relationships between countries in the twentieth century.
We achieve this by looking at major global events throughout the 20th Century and provide an analysis and visualizations of the chain of events that led to the current state of affairs. 

# Data Sources and Requirements
Data was scraped from a Wikipedia web page and was used as the basis for the visual analyses in the report. Since we are looking for textual content, the data analysis will also involve text mining. Once the data is ready for analysis, basic natural language processing (NLP) algorithms were applied to the collected data to extract a relationships map. As a final step, a network analysis visualization was created for all of the data that was scraped and processed.

# Tools Used
I analyzed the data using the Anaconda distrobution of Python with the following libraries:

Pandas - for data analysis
NumPy - for mathematical equations
SciPy - for data equations
Seaborn - for data visulizations
Matplotlib - for data visualizations
NTLK - for Natural Language Processing
Spacy - for Natural Language Processing
Pyvis - for network graph visualizations

# Folders
The project files are broken down into the following folders:

01 Project Management - contains the project brief documentation detailing the analysis
02 Data: Separated into two subfolders Original Data and Prepared Data. These contains the original data frames and the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively. (Data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size.)
03 Scripts - contains the Jupyter notebooks containing the coding for the analysis and visualizations.
04 Visualization - contains all of the graphs and graphics used when developing the final presentation with my insights.
